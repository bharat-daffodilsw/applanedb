Async module for saving
    >> Manjeet (2 days)


Local and admin db saving  :3 days
    !!(only required value or complete replicate the admin db to replicate)(case when some thing change in admin db how will we synch it to localbd using replicatemodule)
Local and admin db merging/query   : 3 days

_id should be saved as objectid as well as in fk
autoinc
default value
collection names should be pl.users, pl.collections etc...




UniqueIndex and query index and with assuming local and admin db --> some method in collectin to synch index on all localdb
    >>> Time estimate pending
Change of column multiple to single, single to multiple -> mongo level issue -- change data in mongo, if object to array, convery in array, if array to object --> keep first object, throw error until it done
    >>> time estimate pending
Cascade
    >>> Self Design and do it verify from yogesh sir
Replicate module when column definiton get changed --> new set fields get added or removed
    >>> Self Design and do it verify from yogesh sir


Metadata in datamodel -- Rohit
Deployment on heroku, assignment to ashu
Domain explore using some error, timeout, whether it can be replacement of child process, Assign to ashu
Cron : Assign to ashu






Auto INC
UDT --> Unit, Schedule,handling of orders and filter in udt
FlexField
RoleModule
Footer aggregate and Total Row count
SelfRecursiveModule For Saving ???
MailSending - Mail Scheduling


Run as separate child process
Time limit on update/query/trigger --> child process
use of gzip data in response

Audit trail
FileModule --> remove fileds, gzip should be a separate module, etc.....
New Module definition as plugin
AggregateIndex,

!!Support of recursion in group by, from task table, group by on assignto and recursive:true
!!Use of promise instead of callback in nodejs
!!documet clone and qury clone are in modulemanager and are done irrespective of that module is required or not
!!Check how to pass date and objectid of mongo to client side so that we do not need to cast in new Date() or new ObjectId()
!!Child vs nested array as fk
!!Timezone handling from client and server
!!Array handling is not full proof --> get old data and then calculate index --> in mean some other has do some changes in that array record
!! Array Rollback if some record delete, and either we have to keep complete old record and will be override otherwise index will be changed
!!  db.getLastErrorObj()


======================DONE====================================
Support __modules__:{module1:1 OR module:0} in query and updates :  >>sachin >> 2 hrs - 02-05-14
